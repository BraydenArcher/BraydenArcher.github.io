Hello! My name is Brayden Archer and I'm currently a rising junior at Johns Hopkins University. This website is to showcase some of the projects I have written for various classes and also serve as a blog for projects I complete in my spare time. Feel free to checkout my <a href="https://github.com/BraydenArcher">GitHub</a> profile. I hope to soon make a few blog posts detailing various projects I have completed in my spare time.
